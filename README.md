# ðŸ›’ CSC211 Store System

A C++ console application developed as a final project for the **Advanced Programming Techniques (CSC 211)** course at the **Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC)**, taught by Professor Dharamraj Kalicharan (MTA IT Manager, MCSE, MCT, ITIL).

This system simulates a complete store order and inventory process, allowing users to:

- Read and process customer orders from files  
- Calculate subtotals, NYC tax (8.875%), and grand totals  
- Generate printable receipts  
- Manage inventory updates and additions via file input/output  
- Navigate through a menu-based interface using C++ classes, structures, vectors, and modular functions

## ðŸ§¾ Sample Receipt

Hereâ€™s an example of a receipt generated by the system:

![Sample Receipt](assets/receipt_demo.png)

> Automatically calculated from an order file using NYCâ€™s 8.875% sales tax.  
> This receipt includes sub-total, tax, and grand total â€” just like a real store system.
